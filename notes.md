    - alignment: steer towards the average heading of local flockmates
    - cohesion: steer to move towards the average position (center of mass) of local flockmates
 - Obsticle Avoidance

## Step 4:
 - Add Triangles 

## Step 5: 
 - Click for ball obsticle
 - Click for triangle shape
 - Move triangles (update angle according to velocity)

## Step 6: 
 - Shapes are repelled from obsticles.
